# Multi-threaded Programming

## Introduction to pthreads

Write a simple, bug-free program that can increment a single variable
using multiple threads.

1. First, start off with multiple threads without a mutex

2. Add a mutex for correctness

```c++
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

#include "time_to_string.h"

using steady_clock = std::chrono::steady_clock;

void incr_x(int& input)
{
	for(std::size_t i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
		input++;
	}
}

int main(void)
{
	int x = 0;
	auto start = steady_clock::now();
	incr_x(x);
	auto end   = steady_clock::now();
	std::cout << "x is " << x << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Took " << ece2400::time_to_string(end - start)
		<< std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

## N-Queens

### Problem statement

Given a N x N chessboard, how many ways you place N queens on the board
such that no two queens can attack each other?

### Outline of solution

This problem is solved through a recursive, backtracking solution. The
recursive solution works in the following way -- the function accepts as
input a partially filled board (filled up to the first k rows), with the
guarantee that none of the queens placed so far can attack each other.
The function then tries to place a queen on the k+1th row in such a
manner that the queen thus placed cannot attack any of the queens
already placed, and recursively adds up the number of possible solutions
from that point onwards. The function continues adding up solutions
until it has explored all viable positions of the k+1th queen on the
k+1th row of the chessboard. The recursion terminates at the last row.

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

size_t nqueens_h(unsigned char* board, size_t board_size, size_t k)
{
	size_t num_sols = 0;
	if(k >= board_size) return 1;
	for(size_t i = 0; i < board_size; i++) {
		int cannot_place = 0;
		for(size_t j = 0; j < k; j++) {
			// Vertical conflict;
			if(board[j] == i) {
				cannot_place = 1;
				break;
			}
			// Left diagonal conflict;
			if(i > board[j] && i - board[j] == k - j) {
				cannot_place = 1;
				break;
			}
			// Right diagonal conflict;
			if(i < board[j] && board[j] - i == k - j) {
				cannot_place = 1;
				break;
			}
		}
		if(! cannot_place) {
			board[k] = (unsigned char) i;
			num_sols += nqueens_h(board, board_size, k + 1);
		}
	}
	return num_sols;
}

size_t nqueens(size_t board_size)
{
	if(board_size > 15) return -1;
	unsigned char board[board_size];
	size_t num_sols = 0;
	for(size_t i = 0; i < board_size; i++) {
		board[0] = (unsigned char) i;
		num_sols += nqueens_h(board, board_size, 1);
	}
	return num_sols;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	if(argc != 2) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s board_size\n", argv[0]);
		return 1;
	}
	size_t board_size = atoi(argv[1]);
	printf("nqueens(%d) = %d\n", board_size, nqueens(board_size));
	return 0;
}
```

### Parallel implementation of n-queens

Use pthreads to implement this algorithm in a parallel fashion.
