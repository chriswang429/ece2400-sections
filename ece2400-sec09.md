# STL, and PA6 in 60 minutes

## Problem statement

0. Count the number of words in a book downloaded from [Project
   Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

     Use `sed` to convert punctuations to spaces, and to strip all
     characters that are not spaces or alphabets.

1. Count the number of unique words in the book.

     - Use `tr` to transform uppercase letters into lowercase letters.

     - Use `std::transform` to accomplish the same goal.

     - Introduce iterators.

2. Count the frequency of words in the book, sorted in alphabetical
   order of words.

3. Show the most frequently occurring words, sorted from most frequently
   occurring to least frequently occurring.

## Optional

There's a speed difference between linked-lists and arrays (or vectors)
that is not captured by big-O notation. Show an example of creating a
list vs creating an array.
