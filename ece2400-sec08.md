# Templates and operator overloading

## A vector template

Start with `vector_t` class from previous section. Convert the class to
be a template.

## Operator overloading

- Overload the `<<` operator to print out a vector to the output.
  Remember to overload this operator for every class that would use the
  `vector_t` template as well.

- Overload the `+` operator to concatenate vectors.
